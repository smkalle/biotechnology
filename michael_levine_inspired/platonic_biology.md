### Introduction
Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, recently shared an intriguing idea on X, responding to Ethan Mollick’s post about language models converging on a "universal geometry" of meaning, suggesting a Platonic structure. Levin linked this to biology, proposing that cognitive and morphological patterns in living organisms might also arise from a similar abstract space, not just genetics or environment. This concept is rooted in his work on bioelectric signals and basal cognition, exploring how cells communicate to shape development and regeneration. His ideas, detailed in an article published on [thoughtforms.life](https://thoughtforms.life/) in April 2025, suggest that evolution and bioengineering create physical interfaces for patterns from this Platonic space, impacting fields like synthetic biology and AI.

### Levin’s Work and Implications
Levin’s research focuses on bioelectric signals, showing how cells use electrical communication to coordinate during development and regeneration. This work, including creating Xenobots from frog cells, suggests cells have basic cognitive abilities, solving problems and adapting. His hypothesis is that biological systems might tap into a non-physical Platonic realm for higher-agency patterns like minds, similar to how AI embeddings reveal universal semantic structures. This idea, that life and mind are "midwifed" by matter rather than fully constructed, challenges traditional views and opens new avenues for synthetic biology and AI, though it remains a debated topic in scientific circles.

### Relevance to Bioinformatics
For bioinformatics students, Levin’s work offers computational angles, like modeling bioelectric networks to predict biological outcomes. Tools like machine learning could analyze bioelectric data, identifying patterns in development or disease, bridging biology and AI through shared abstract structures.

### Survey Note: Exploring Michael Levin’s Vision of a Platonic Space for Life and Mind

#### Introduction and Context
Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, has made significant contributions to understanding bioelectricity in developmental biology, with implications for cognition, regeneration, and the intersection of biology and artificial intelligence (AI). His recent X post, responding to Ethan Mollick’s discussion of a paper on language models converging on a "universal geometry" of meaning, highlights a fascinating parallel. Mollick’s post, available at [this X post](https://x.com/drmichaellevin/status/1925918308651467175), referenced research suggesting AI models reveal a Platonic structure underlying meaning. Levin linked this to biology, proposing that cognitive and morphological patterns in living organisms may also stem from a similar abstract, non-physical space, not solely determined by genetics or environment.

This idea is detailed in Levin’s article, "Living things are not machines (also, they totally are)," published on [thoughtforms.life](https://thoughtforms.life/living-things-are-not-machines-also-they-totally-are/) in April 2025, a pre-editing version of a piece in Noēma. The article, accessible at [this URL](https://www.noemamag.com/living-things-are-not-machines-also-they-totally-are/), explores the philosophical and scientific distinctions between life and machines, suggesting these categories are not binary but interconnected through abstract patterns.

#### Levin’s Background and Research Focus
Levin, with dual bachelor’s degrees in computer science and biology from Tufts and a Ph.D. in genetics from Harvard, has a unique interdisciplinary background. His research, detailed on [his lab’s publications page](https://drmichaellevin.org/publications/), focuses on bioelectrical signals—ion-based voltage gradients used by cells to communicate—serving the dynamic anatomical needs of organisms during development, regeneration, and cancer suppression. Notable works include co-discovering Xenobots, living robots made from frog skin cells, as noted on [his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levin_%28biologist%29).

His concept of *basal cognition*, explored in papers like "The Computational Boundary of a 'Self': Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition" ([Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full)), posits that cells and tissues have basic information-processing capabilities, enabling problem-solving and adaptation. This is supported by studies like "Bioelectric networks: the cognitive glue enabling evolutionary scaling from physiology to mind" ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37204591/)), which discusses how bioelectricity facilitates cognitive scaling from single cells to complex organisms.

#### The Platonic Space Hypothesis
Levin’s response to Mollick suggests that just as language models converge on a universal geometry of meaning, biological systems might tap into a Platonic space—a non-physical realm of ideal forms or patterns. This idea, detailed in his April 2025 article, challenges the traditional view that biological forms are solely genetic or environmentally determined. Instead, he proposes bioelectric networks manifest patterns from this abstract space, guiding development and regeneration.

For example, his work on Xenobots, detailed in "Motile Living Biobots Self-Construct from Adult Human Somatic Progenitor Seed Cells" ([Advanced Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202303575)), shows cells can form novel structures, suggesting access to abstract blueprints. This aligns with his article’s claim that "life" is systems aligning parts toward an expanded cognitive light cone, revealing creative, agential aspects, as seen in [this section](https://thoughtforms.life/living-things-are-not-machines-also-they-totally-are/).

#### Bioelectric Signals and Basal Cognition: Detailed Insights
Levin’s research, supported by studies like "Multicellular adaptation to electrophysiological perturbations analyzed by deterministic and stochastic bioelectrical models" ([Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79087-7)), shows bioelectric signals are crucial for embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression. Cells use ion channels and gap junctions for communication, as detailed in "Gap junctional signaling in pattern regulation: physiological network connectivity instructs growth and form" ([Dev. Neurobiol.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dneu.22405)).

Basal cognition, explored in "From reinforcement learning to agency: Frameworks for understanding basal cognition" ([BioSystems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030326472300188X)), suggests cells have goal-directed behaviors, forming multicellular organisms with emergent cognitive properties. This is evidenced by experiments showing cells respond to acoustic stimuli, as in "Basal Xenobots show significantly larger inter-individual gene variability" ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370899618_Bioelectric_networks_the_cognitive_glue_enabling_evolutionary_scaling_from_physiology_to_mind)).

Key points from "The Computational Boundary of a 'Self'" include:
- **Definition of Self/Individual**: Defined by goal-pursuit ability, using Test-Operate-Test-Exit (TOTE) loops, scaling from homeostasis to complex cognition ([Figure 1, Figure 2](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688)).
- **Role of Bioelectricity**: Enables cell communication for embryogenesis, regeneration, using ion signals and gap junctions, linked to neural evolution ([Levin, 2012](#ref151), [Levin et al., 2017](#ref154)).
- **Cognitive Scaling**: Evolves from single-cell to multicellular agency, driven by memory, prediction, and infotaxis ([Fields and Levin, 2019](#ref82)).
- **Multicellularity vs. Cancer**: Cancer breaks bioelectric communication, shrinking cognitive boundaries to single cells ([Chernet and Levin, 2013a](#ref50), [Lobikin et al., 2012](#ref161)).
- **Evolutionary Steps**: From homeostasis to allostasis, using chemotaxis and syncytia formation ([Vergassola et al., 2007](#ref284), [Prindle et al., 2015](#ref228)).
- **Functional Isomorphism**: Parallels between anatomical and cognitive processes, using ion channels like GABA, Auxin ([Ramesh et al., 2015](#ref230), [Pfeifer et al., 2007a](#ref215)).
- **Scale-Free Cognition**: Cognition as continuum, with nested selves, testable in interdisciplinary research ([Box summary, Figure 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9552)).

Detailed studies, as summarized in the table below, further illustrate these concepts:

#### Implications for Synthetic Biology and AI
Levin’s article hypothesizes that evolution and bioengineering create physical interfaces for patterns from the Platonic space, impacting synthetic biology and AI. In synthetic biology, understanding bioelectric networks could lead to new methods for tissue engineering, as seen in "The body electric 2.0: recent advances in developmental bioelectricity for regenerative and synthetic bioengineering" ([Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2018.03.008)). For AI, the parallelism with language models suggests designing systems to explore abstract structures, potentially revolutionizing machine learning, as discussed in "On artificial beings" ([thoughtforms.life](https://thoughtforms.life/on-artificial-beings/)).

The idea that life and mind are "midwifed" by matter, rather than fully constructed, challenges physicalist views, critiqued in the article using examples like the movie *Ex Machina*, and calls for humility and pluralism in scientific research, referencing Lisa Feldman Barrett’s work ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5736315/)).

#### Computational Aspects for Bioinformatics
For bioinformatics students, Levin’s work offers computational models, like those in "Bioelectric gene and reaction networks: computational modelling of genetic, biochemical and bioelectrical dynamics in pattern regulation" ([J. R. Soc. Interface](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0425)), to predict bioelectric patterns. Machine learning could analyze bioelectric data, identifying developmental or disease patterns, as suggested in "Who’s the data? Implications of thoughts-are-thinkers continuum for developmental bioelectricity" ([thoughtforms.life](https://thoughtforms.life/whos-the-data-implications-of-thoughts-are-thinkers-continuum-for-developmental-bioelectricity/)).

The scale-free cognition hypothesis, with nested selves, could inspire algorithms for hierarchical information processing, bridging biology and AI through shared abstract structures, as explored in "Diverse intelligence in plants and beyond: a talk and some downloadable resources" ([thoughtforms.life](https://thoughtforms.life/diverse-intelligence-in-plants-and-beyond-a-talk-and-some-downloadable-resources/)).

#### Conclusion
Levin’s vision of a Platonic space underlying biological patterns enriches our understanding of life and mind, suggesting deep connections with AI. For bioinformatics students, it highlights computational approaches to analyze bioelectric data and model cognitive processes, opening new research avenues at the intersection of biology, computer science, and philosophy.
